  "brand_name": "Tesla",
  "executive_summary": "Tesla's brand memorability is a study in contrasts. It scores exceptionally high in Story and Attention, driven by a powerful, almost mythic founder narrative and a constant stream of media coverage. However, this is significantly undermined by a growing weakness in Consistency and a polarizing Emotion score, where the brand's promise of a sustainable future clashes with customer experiences of service issues and quality control. The key strategic challenge is to bridge this widening gap between the myth and the reality.",
